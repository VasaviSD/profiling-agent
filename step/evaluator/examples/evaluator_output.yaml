  comparison_summary: |
    The ORIGINAL perf report shows nearly all CPU cycles (97.45%) spent in a single function, perform_heavy_computation(int), indicating a purely single-threaded workload. In contrast, the VARIANT report shows a similar high percentage (96.78%) spent in perform_heavy_computation_worker(int, int, int, std::atomic<double>&), but this time executed in multiple threads (evidenced by clone3 and start_thread calls). The VARIANT report also shows small overheads in thread management and atomic operations. Overall, the VARIANT shifts the main computation into a parallelized worker function, suggesting a multi-threaded approach.
  is_improvement: true
  improvement_details: |
    - The main computational hotspot shifted from perform_heavy_computation (97.45%) in the ORIGINAL to perform_heavy_computation_worker (96.78%) in the VARIANT.
    - The VARIANT introduces threading overhead (clone3 and start_thread) but it is minimal (~1.17% combined).
    - The VARIANT's atomic usage to accumulate results adds about 1.16% overhead (name_stack_maps).
    - Given the VARIANT uses multiple threads (likely equal to hardware concurrency), it should reduce wall-clock runtime significantly by parallelizing the workload.
    - The slight overhead introduced by threading and atomic operations is outweighed by the parallel execution benefit.

  detailed_analysis: |
    The ORIGINAL version runs the heavy computation in a single function on one thread, consuming nearly 100% of CPU cycles in that function. This indicates a fully serial workload.

    The VARIANT splits the computation among multiple threads, each running perform_heavy_computation_worker over a subset of the iteration space. The perf report confirms this by showing clone3 and start_thread calls, which are typical for thread creation and management in Linux. The main hotspot shifts to perform_heavy_computation_worker, which accounts for 96.78% of cycles, very close to the original function's overhead but now distributed across threads.

    The overhead from threading (clone3, start_thread) and atomic operations (name_stack_maps) is small (around 1-2%), suggesting the multi-threaded approach is efficient and does not introduce significant synchronization or thread management costs.

    Since the VARIANT uses hardware concurrency to parallelize the workload, it is expected to reduce total execution time roughly by the number of cores, assuming perfect scaling and no other bottlenecks. The perf data supports this by showing the workload spread out across threads, which is a clear improvement over the single-threaded original.

    No major new bottlenecks appear in the VARIANT, and the overheads introduced are typical and minimal for parallel execution. The atomic<double> usage for result accumulation is a minor synchronization point but well handled.

    Overall, the VARIANT is a well-implemented parallelization of the original code, trading off minimal threading overhead for a large expected gain in runtime performance.
