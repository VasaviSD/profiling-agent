# Perf Output Data

This directory is used to store data generated by the Linux `perf` tool during performance analysis.

This includes:
- `perf.data` files: Raw profiling data collected by `perf record`.
- Text reports: Human-readable reports generated by `perf report` or `perf script`.

The AI agent will manage the creation and potentially the parsing of files in this directory.
