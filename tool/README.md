# Profiling Agent Tools

This directory (`tool/`) contains various utility scripts and helper modules that support the functionality of the main profiling agents (found in the `step/` directory).

These tools typically encapsulate specific, recurring tasks such as interacting with external programs (like compilers or profilers), parsing their output, or performing common code manipulations.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these tools is to:

-   **Abstract Complexity:** Provide a simpler interface for agents to use complex external utilities (e.g., Linux `perf`, C++ compilers).
-   **Promote Reusability:** Offer common functionalities that might be needed by multiple agents or in different parts of the pipeline.
-   **Encapsulate Logic:** Keep specialized logic (like parsing specific output formats) separate from the core agent orchestration logic.

## Available Tool Categories

Subdirectories within `tool/` group related utilities:

### 1. Compile Utilities (`tool/compile/`)

-   **Purpose:** Likely contains tools related to compiling C++ source code.
-   **Functionality:** This might include scripts to invoke a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) with specific flags, manage build processes, and check for compilation errors. These tools would be crucial for verifying the syntactic correctness of code variants generated by agents like the Replicator, or for preparing code for performance testing.
-   **Details:** See `tool/compile/README.md` for more information.

### 2. Performance Profiling Utilities (`tool/perf/`)

-   **Purpose:** Likely contains tools for interacting with performance profiling utilities, primarily the Linux `perf` tool.
-   **Functionality:** This could involve scripts to execute `perf record` commands with appropriate arguments for collecting performance data (e.g., CPU cycles, cache misses, call graphs), and potentially utilities to process or convert `perf.data` files or parse the output of `perf report` / `perf script`.
-   **Details:** See `tool/perf/README.md` for more information.

## Usage

These tools are generally not run directly by the user as standalone applications. Instead, they are imported and used by the agents in the `step/` directory as needed to perform their tasks.

For example, the `Analyzer` agent might use tools from `tool/perf/` to help interpret `perf` data, and the `Replicator` or a future `Evaluator` agent might use tools from `tool/compile/` to build and test generated C++ code variants.
