# C++ Source Files for Profiling

This directory should contain the C++ source code files (e.g., `.cpp`, `.h`) that you want the AI agent to analyze and optimize for performance.

Initially, you can place a sample C++ program here. The agent will look for C++ files in this location to begin its profiling and optimization workflow.
